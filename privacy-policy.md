A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.

### 4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice, unless otherwise required by law.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for more than three (3) months after the termination of the user's account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If deletion or anonymization is not possible (for instance, if your personal information is stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is feasible.

### 5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We strive to protect your personal information through a combination of organizational and technical security measures.

We have put in place appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures to safeguard any personal information we process. Despite these efforts, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to breach our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. While we are committed to protecting your personal information, transmitting personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should access the Services only within a secure environment.

If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from someone under 18 years of age, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable steps to promptly delete such information from our records.
